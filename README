This is my solution built during the extended round of the Google HashCode 2017 competition - Final Round

- inputs folder contains the problem statement and the input files (https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/past_editions.html);
- outputs folder contains the files output of the code to be submitted to get scores (Extended round ended and it's not possible to submit new solutions);
- maps folder contains a text file for each input with the grid coverage guaranteed by the output file - to see how good I did
- router.php is the actual file containing the code. 

Remark: This solution brings to 530 mln points while the best result is about 550mln. 
Remark2: The way how the variable max_coverage is changed deeply influence the time execution.
Remark3: All files were in a single folder so you have to move *.in files in the same folder as router.php to run the code.
